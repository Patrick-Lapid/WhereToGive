# Where To Give

# Project Description

This application will be a multipurpose donation site that pipelines generous donors to nonprofits that align to their interests. It will support user authentication for login and storing user specific data. Users will be prompted to fill out a form to provide information such as location and causes they care about. Based on the information input into the form, the application will categorize and rank nonprofits to point donors in the right direction based on the information input into the form. As a nice to have feature, the application will also provide donors a way to self-report their donations and track where their funds get allocated over time.
