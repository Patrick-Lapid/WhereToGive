# Project Name: Where To Give

# Project Description

This application will be a multipurpose donation site that pipelines generous donors to nonprofits that align to their interests. It will support user authentication for login and storing user specific data. Users will be prompted to fill out a form to provide personal information such as location and causes they care about. The user's information will be saved to a database and the form will be auto-populated every time they visit the site. Based on this information collected from the user, the application will categorize and rank nonprofits to best fit the user's interest. The application will provide users the capability to visit the website of their non-profit of choice to make their donations. Another feature the application will provide users is the capability to self-report donations for visual tracking with statements and graphs where you can select and view certain non-profit categories.
